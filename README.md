Notipi
======

For students at NTNU or HiST, Trondheim, Norway.

If your student union ("linjeforening") wants to purchase a Notipi, contact Omega Verksted. Notipi allows your student union to get even more out of [Online Notifier](https://github.com/appKom/notifier/): Coffee status, office status (open/closed), meeting status and more.

This software is made my the Application Committee in Online. The software is made for the Notipis that are built by Omega Verksted for each student organization in Trondheim, Norway.

The software delivers data to a server running [Online Notiwire](https://github.com/appKom/notiwire/), which in turn delivers data to [Online Notifier](https://github.com/appKom/notifier/). Online Notifier is a free + ad-free browser extension that may be added from here:
* http://bit.ly/NotifierForChrome
* http://bit.ly/NotifierForOpera

Both Online and OmegaV are student unions at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway. Feel free to contact us.
* appkom@online.ntnu.no (Notipi software)
* omegav@omegav.no (Notipi hardware)
